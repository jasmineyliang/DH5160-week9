# Mini-Project: Advanced Data Visualization with Tableau

## Objective
Expand on the basic Tableau BI assignment by adding new features and visualizations to create a comprehensive data analysis dashboard. This project will help you develop advanced Tableau skills and showcase your ability to analyze and visualize data effectively.

## Steps

### 1. Complete the Basic Assignment
- Follow the initial steps provided in the assignment to download Tableau Public, install it, and create an account.
- Use the "Sample - Superstore" dataset and follow the tutorial to create an interactive dashboard that includes:
  - A Map visualization
  - Area charts
  - A Text table
  - A Bar chart

### 2. Enhance the Dashboard with Advanced Features

1. **Add a Sales Trend Analysis:**
   - Create a line chart to visualize sales trends over time.
   - Include filters for year, month, and region to allow dynamic analysis.
   - Highlight any significant trends or anomalies.

2. **Create a Sales Forecast:**
   - Use Tableau’s built-in forecasting feature to predict future sales based on historical data.
   - Display the forecasted sales in a separate line chart and compare it with actual sales.

3. **Implement a Customer Segmentation Analysis:**
   - Group customers based on their purchasing behavior (e.g., high-value vs. low-value customers).
   - Create a segmented bar chart or pie chart to visualize the distribution of customer segments.

4. **Add an Interactive Profit Margin Calculator:**
   - Create a calculated field for profit margin.
   - Use parameters to allow users to adjust cost and price inputs, updating the profit margin dynamically.

5. **Incorporate a Geo Heat Map:**
   - Enhance the map visualization by creating a heat map that shows regions with the highest and lowest sales.
   - Use color gradients to represent different levels of sales performance.

6. **Design a Dashboard Overview:**
   - Summarize key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total profit, and average order value in a clean and interactive dashboard overview.
   - Allow users to drill down into specific categories or regions for more detailed insights.

### 3. Documentation and Presentation
- Write a short report (1-2 pages) explaining the additional features you implemented, why you chose them, and the insights gained from the enhanced dashboard.
- Include screenshots of your visualizations and a brief explanation of each.
- Upload your Tableau workbook file and report to the repo.

### 4. Submission
- Ensure your Tableau workbook is polished and user-friendly.
- Upload the completed workbook file, along with the report, to the specified repository.
